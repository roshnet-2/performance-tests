# performance-tests
Codes (generally Python) to illustrate how time-complexities to deal with the same logic in different ways can make a huge impact on system performance.

For example, functions are usually made for code reusability. But, in loops that run a large # of times, calling a function again and again is not a feasible solution. A code inside demonstrates the same.
